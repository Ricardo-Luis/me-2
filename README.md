# Notebooks Computacionais Aplicados a Máquinas Elétricas II
Applied Computational Notebooks for Electric Machinery II

## Overview
This [website](https://ricardo-luis.github.io/me-2/) provides a collection of computational notebooks supporting the [Electric Machinery II](https://www.isel.pt/sites/default/files/FUC_202425_3894.pdf) course in the Electrical Engineering undergraduate program at [ISEL](https://www.isel.pt/en). 

Developed using [Pluto.jl](https://plutojl.org/) (an environment for the [**Julia**](https://julialang.org/) language), the collection is organized into 4 topics: 
- Fundamentals
- DC Electric Machine
- Three-phase Synchronous Machine
- Electric Machines Dynamics

The [website](https://ricardo-luis.github.io/me-2/) is primarily in Portuguese, with future plans to become bilingual (Portuguese/English).
